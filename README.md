In a machine learning project utilizing the German Credit Risk dataset, diverse classifier techniques,
including XGBoost, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, were applied to predict loan risk for financial institutions. 
The objective was to efficiently categorize loans as risky or safe, aiding banks in making informed lending decisions.
Through rigorous analysis and model training, this study sought to identify the most effective method for assessing credit risk, 
providing a valuable tool for banks to streamline their loan approval processes and minimize potential financial liabilities.
